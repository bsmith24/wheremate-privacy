# WhereMate – Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** September 15, 2025
**Developer / Data Controller:** **\[Company/Developer Name]** (“we”, “us”, “our”)
**Contact:** **\[[privacy@yourdomain.com](mailto:privacy@yourdomain.com)]** • **\[Postal address, City, State/Region, Country]**

---

## Quick Summary (Plain‑Language)

* **Local‑first.** Your photos, labels, and item data are stored **on your device** in the app’s sandbox.
* **No account. No cloud.** We don’t run a backend for WhereMate and we don’t require you to sign in.
* **Optional Photos save.** If you choose, WhereMate can save an item photo to your iPhone’s Photos library.
* **Reminders are local.** Notifications are scheduled and delivered locally on your device (no push server).
* **No tracking.** We don’t use third‑party ads or analytics SDKs in the app.
* **Support only.** If you email us, we’ll receive your contact details and message—used only to respond.

If you read nothing else: **we don’t upload your item content to our servers because we don’t have servers for WhereMate.**

---

## Scope

This policy describes how the **WhereMate** iOS app and any related in‑app settings handle information. It does **not** cover third‑party websites, app store listings, or platforms we don’t control. If you visit our website or contact us by email, this policy explains what we receive in those cases.

---

## Information We Process

### 1) On‑Device Content (stored locally)

* **What:** Item photos, drawings/annotations, text labels, dates, and reminder schedules.
* **Where:** Stored in the app’s sandbox (e.g., *Application Support*).
* **Why:** To let you capture and find where things live.
* **Sharing/Upload:** **None.** We don’t transmit this content to us or to third parties.

> **Note on device backups:** If you use iCloud or encrypted computer backups, iOS may include WhereMate’s app data in those backups under Apple’s control.

### 2) Optional Photos Library Access

* **What:** If you toggle “Save to Photos,” a copy of your item photo is written to the Photos library.
* **Where:** Managed by Apple’s Photos app under your device settings.
* **Sharing/Upload:** We do not upload it; Apple and iCloud Photos behavior is governed by Apple’s policies and your device settings.

### 3) Local Notifications

* **What:** Reminder schedules and notification delivery.
* **Where:** Generated and delivered **on device**.
* **Sharing/Upload:** We do not use remote push or send notification tokens to servers.

### 4) Purchases & App Store

* **What:** If you buy WhereMate Pro (e.g., monthly/annual/lifetime), purchases are processed by **Apple**.
* **What we receive:** We do **not** receive your payment card details. We may see anonymized sales reports from Apple (e.g., totals by country).
* **Sharing/Upload:** No purchase data is uploaded by the app to us.

### 5) Diagnostics & Crash Reporting (Apple‑provided, optional)

* **What:** If you’ve enabled Apple’s “Share iPhone Analytics” and “Share with App Developers,” we may receive **aggregated** crash logs and performance metrics via Apple.
* **Identifiers:** These reports don’t include information that directly identifies you.
* **Opt‑out:** Control this under iOS **Settings → Privacy & Security → Analytics & Improvements**.

### 6) Support Communications

* **What:** If you email us, we receive your email address and the contents of your message (and any attachments).
* **Use:** To respond and resolve your request, improve support quality, and maintain records as required by law.

---

## What We **Don’t** Do

* **No user accounts** for WhereMate.
* **No cloud sync** operated by us.
* **No third‑party advertising SDKs.**
* **No behavior‑based tracking** or cross‑app tracking.
* **No sale or sharing** of personal information for targeted advertising.

---

## Legal Bases (EU/UK only)

Where applicable under GDPR/UK GDPR:

* **Performance of a contract:** Providing the app’s core features you request.
* **Consent:** Access to Camera/Photos, sending notifications—requested through iOS permissions.
* **Legitimate interests:** App maintenance and quality (e.g., Apple‑provided crash logs), and responding to support emails.

You may withdraw consent at any time via iOS Settings (e.g., disable Camera/Photos/Notifications).

---

## Your Choices & Controls

* **Permissions:** Manage Camera, Photos, and Notifications in **iOS Settings → WhereMate**.
* **Delete content:** Delete items inside the app; uninstalling the app removes its sandboxed data from your device.
* **Backups:** To remove data from device backups, follow Apple’s instructions for managing iCloud or local backups.
* **Support data:** Email us at **\[[privacy@yourdomain.com](mailto:privacy@yourdomain.com)]** to request deletion of prior support emails (we may retain minimal records where legally required).

---

## Data Security

Your content lives in WhereMate’s iOS sandbox and benefits from iOS data protection. If your device has a passcode/Face ID/Touch ID, iOS encrypts data at rest. We recommend enabling a device passcode and keeping your iOS up to date.

> If we offer an optional in‑app lock (Face ID/Touch ID), biometric matching happens on your device via iOS; we don’t receive or store biometric data.

---

## Data Retention

* **On‑device app data:** Kept until you delete it or uninstall the app.
* **Support emails:** Retained for **\[e.g., 24 months]** unless you ask us to delete earlier (subject to legal obligations).
* **Aggregated diagnostics:** Retained in Apple’s developer portals per Apple’s timelines.

---

## Children’s Privacy

WhereMate is a general‑audience app and does not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us personal information via support email, contact us and we’ll delete it.

---

## Sharing & Disclosures

We do not sell or share personal information. We may disclose information only:

* to comply with applicable law or legal process;
* to protect the safety, rights, or property of users, the public, or our company;
* to a successor in the event of a business transfer (only to the extent permitted by law, with continued protection of this data).

---

## International Users

We do not operate servers for WhereMate data. If you contact us or visit our website, your correspondence may be processed in **\[Country/Region]** where we are based. Privacy laws may differ from your jurisdiction.

---

## California (CCPA/CPRA) Notice

We are not in the business of selling or sharing personal information. If you contact us and we hold personal information about you in a consumer context, you may request access or deletion by emailing **\[[privacy@yourdomain.com](mailto:privacy@yourdomain.com)]**. We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy to reflect product, legal, or operational changes. We will update the **Effective date** above and, when material, provide in‑app notice or other reasonable means. Please review this policy periodically.

* **Photos (Add/Write):** *Optional.* Save a copy of an item photo to your Photos library if you enable this.

### Appendix B – App Store “Privacy Nutrition Label” Guidance (for your listing)

Based on the current design (no third‑party analytics SDKs, no accounts, no network collection), your label will likely be:

* **Data Collected:** *None*
* **Data Used to Track You:** *None*

> If you later add analytics, crash SDKs, or any network collection, you **must** update your App Store privacy answers accordingly.
